Dear Android developers of . . . . . .


We are Sixdots Software and we see that a lot of reviews seem to be bought, we don't like this since it sets  back small and independent developers. (also we don't like to pay for reviews)

We also see that google latest policy change punishes app makers asking its user to review the app in the app itself.

Therefor we developed a webapp: ‘Trade A Rate’ , now you can trade ratings with other app developers.

It is simple, you start or join a trade, by filling in the app id of the app you want to have reviewed.

The other developer does the same thing, you both accept the trade (if all seems fair).

The trade a rate system will now start checking if the both of you did the rating of the other developers app.

if you did, you both have an extra rating and a few points to do some more trading in the future.

Perhaps you will find this an interesting idea and are willing to give it a try.
